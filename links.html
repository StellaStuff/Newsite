        <h2>Cool Sites</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://mitxela.com/" target="_blank">mitxela.com</a> - Mitxela, otherwise known as that one youtuber who you forget exists until he uploads a cool project roughly once a year is a maker who has a lovely website that documents his work which I would describe as beautifuly crafted objects of great uselessness. I'm a huge fan of his work, check him out. </li>
          <li><a href="https://www.bigclive.com/" target="_blank">bigclive.com</a> - If you've been on the more interesting (boring) side of youtube then you probably know who BigClive is. This is his website from the dialup era of the internet. It is full of cool projects and very low resolution images, a good fit for retro web browsing.</li>
          <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030607012817/https://web.media.mit.edu/~tim/pix/cuba.html" target="_blank">To Cuba (almost) by Outrigger Sailing Canoe April 2003</a> - Sadly this page is no longer on the internet so here's an archive. This is the account of a guy named Tim Anderson who attemted to sail from florida to cuba in 2003 and had a whole lot of type 3 fun along the way. I have no idea who Tim is but I found his old website and <a href="https://www.instructables.com/How-Not-To-1/" target="_blank">instructables page</a> (cw: gore) to be quite entertaining the last time I was bored out of my fucking mind. He's a good writer and has a fatherly, educational tone to his articles which I really enjoy. I hope he's still around somewhere.</li>
          <li><a href="https://blondihacks.com/" target="_blank">Blondihacks.com</a> - Blondihacks has a machining youtube channel but she also has a website documenting more electronics oriented projects (she will also yell at you for being a bad commenter (you terrible commenter!!!))</li>
          <li><a href="http://tom7.org/" target="_blank">Tom Murphy 7's Invincible Web Page</a> - Tom7 aka suckerpinch aka that <i>other</i> youtuber who you forget exists until he uploads a cool project roughly once a year is an interesting guy with a PhD and a blog that's older than I am and he does a lot of interesting things with code that I don't quite understand but I'm along for the ride anyways. I first heard of him through his ai that could (poorly) play any NES game in the world which was featured in a vsauce video of all things. I've been in love with his work ever since.</li>
          <li><a href="https://gekk.info/" target="_blank">cathode ray dude dot com</a> - This is a simple html page created by the youtuber Cathode Ray Dude (I knew him before he was cool hmpf) this has some neat computery articles.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.begaydocrime.com/" target="_blank">Hack this Shopping Cart</a> - This is a website that hosts audio files that allows you to unlock those stupid locking shopping cart wheels with your phone.</li>
          <li><a href="https://mle-online.com/projects/" target="_blank">Emily Velasco's project page</a> - This is a site documenting the projects of Emily Velasco who is someone I've followed since the twitter days. Cool site, cool projects, cool person. Lots of cool stuff in the blacket fort webring if you want to keep exploring.</li>
          <li><a href="https://atomicshrimp.com/" target="_blank">AtomicShrimp.com</a> - You might know Atomic Shrimp from his youtube channel but he originally started out with this website which included articles about things like recyling HDPE plastic, building a wooden boat with no prior experiance, woodworking, cooking, foraging, lots of fun stuff. sadly he is no longer updating the site as youtube is his main focus but there is a lot of interesting stuff here. His style of writing is very relaxing and most of what he works on can be easily replicated. definitely one of my favorite sites.</li>
